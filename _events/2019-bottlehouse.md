This past weekend marked the first official event hosted by the Cleveland Rocs Old School club. Registration was capped early, and 38 Magicians converged in Cleveland, making a strong statement about the amount of Old School interest in Ohio. This event was run as a charity for the Providence House, a local child services group in Cleveland. The event was run as Swiss with no playoff, for a total of 6 rounds on the day.
