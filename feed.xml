To follow is a quick report on the only “fall soup” themed MtG event of the year! (as far as I know)…</p> <p>I’ve always been a sucker for quaint and offbeat MtG events. I try to attend many, but make sure to host at least one from the heart each year. Cube has emerged as one of my favorite casual ways that I can share what I love about MtG with those around me without barrier. Previous recent years have included: Lorwyn, Onslaught Block, 93/95, ante-cube, and Vanguard events. I was happy to add “Soup on Sarpadia” to the list for 2025.</p> <h1 id="the-event">The Event</h1> <p>This event was simple: 3 round “Sarpadia Remastered” Cube Draft, modern rules with mana burn. Entry: a homemade dish, prizes were donated, and one player would walk away as the Soup-reme ruler of Sarpadia!</p> <p>The “Sarpadia Remastered” cube is a personal, immersive design and somewhat of a favorite amongst my facets of MtG. I’m thankful for the continued interest in it! (Maybe someday I’ll write more about it). In short, it features Fallen Empires as the base set, and themes mainly from the fringe continents of early Dominaria. It showcases cards from 1993 to present. It is a casual product of years of FE40 online league results with fluid updates based on previous reps, and an unhealthy personal dive into the deep lore of early Magic. This is truly a unique environment featuring unlikely heroes –all cubes are best shared on the kitchen table with beer and 7 others… or in this case a soup cook-off!!</p> <h1 id="cube-list">Cube List</h1> <p><a href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/SarpadiaRemastered">Cube List Here</a></p> <h1 id="attendees-and-soup">Attendees and Soup</h1> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>An all-star crew of Rocs, and other close friends/enthusiasts accounted for easily 150+ years of Magic experience in the room (with a healthy variety of reps in the cube) – truly a valuable group for the continued assessment of this limited card pool.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Brad Wayne, Mitty Harmon, Paul Blakely, Mike Klements, Taylor Kane, Christopher Benson, Halle McLaughlin + Kevin Kelsey.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/soup-on-sarpadia/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Personal opinion, nothing pairs with Sarpadia (or OS mtg) more than a little neat Laphroaig – a perfect match with dark peaty notes of seaweed and smoke.

Did not see that coming at all. GGs Shane, a really cool guy.</p> <p>Round 2 vs Haden 0-2 Black White</p> <p>Game 1 he dropped too many lions and white knights and su chi and serras. I cloned a su chi and he disenchanted it. Game 2 I sided in all my power and was able to clone a Serra but he eventually played Armageddon with one lion in play and beat me down with the lion. Hello from St Louis.</p> <p>Round 3 vs Kevin B 1-2 Candleflare</p> <p>I knew Kevin’s entire list because I loaned him the cards. It didn’t matter. His candleflare insanity was too overwhelming for my limited number of counterspells and too much creature interaction for a nearly creatureless deck.</p> <p>I won game 1 with a factory chipping in while he tried to assemble a lethal candle flare fireball. Luckily he missed an orb flip on that factory. Lost game 2 to a balance into a pair of fireballs and some factory damage. Lost game 3 when he played his entire hand turn one to timetwister and then was able to chip in with atog and land 3 mana flares on a single turn to fireball me for the win</p> <p>Round 4 vs (Thrash Bash 3 Champion) Eric W 2-1 Enchantress Tax Edge (so cool)</p> <p>Game 1 he used balance to balance us out and killed me with tax edge. I stole his Serra but had to sac her to the diamond valley Game 2 he landed a wood elemental with an audience but I was able to unsummon it immediately and win using his own land’s edge and boomeranging my own land to my hand for the final 2 damage.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/thrash4/woodelemental-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/thrash4/woodelemental-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/thrash4/woodelemental-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/thrash4/woodelemental.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Game 3 went to orb flips with us both at 3 life and I got lucky</p> <p>Round 5 vs scotsworth 0-2 black red</p> <p>Game 1 I unsummoned and boomeranged his hippie 4 times but he still ripped enough cards from me to win with hippie and fireball</p> <p>Game 2 he had trolls and I had factories and a dib and we went back and forth. I had him down to 4 and tried to timetwister into a psi blast but missed then I cast ancestral recall and in response he double bolted me for the win.</p> <h2 id="swag">Swag</h2> <p>Thanks Spencer for making me an honorary Kobold for the day.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/thrash4/kobolds-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/thrash4/kobolds-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/thrash4/kobolds-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/thrash4/kobolds.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>I couldn’t keep my eyes off this dragon print so I gave a measly $20 to Tom and stole it from Susan.

The Ohio Heroes hosted an X-point 93/94 event (2nd “annual”) in Brookdale Ohio at the Sharon University Club – a cozy venue secluded in the woods near the OH/PA border.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Personally I have a foot in so many pools playing Magic that taking on another meta seemed like a daunting task, but the Heroes have been fantastic allies to our Cleveland local scene and FE40, and Xpt was quite interesting to me, so I couldn’t pass this one up!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Xpt is a variation of 93/94 OS that has a point limitation to builds. It has gained traction in the past few years, and I honestly felt a bit “late to the party”, but just dove in. I began brewing on merfolk (surprise) but drifted from the idea quickly with the limitations on the 10 point inclusion. At the Elks Lodge OS event at eternal weekend ’25 I brewed around Fallen Angel, and this seemed like a great opportunity to build on that further. My final decklist landed as such:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Fellow FE40+Roc Craig Snook and I coordinated to arrive together and, as usual, I got hung up and was rushing in the door. It was great to see (many) familiar faces, and I wish I had a bit more time to just catch up, but it was time for the tournament! 20ish OS players squared off for 5 rounds. Warm/home-made food, quick A40 and FE40 side matches, cool prizes to pursue, door prize drawings, and just a gorgeous fall day spent in the woods made for an exceptionally positive and comfortable event! My B/G “Angel Food” ended up 4-1 and placing second overall!</p> <p>Those that stayed for the whole tournament!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="tournament">Tournament</h2> <p>Here’s a brief report of my day. I’m not going to get into the gritty details, and I apologize if anything is misattributed (writing from memory only). I’ll mention highlights and my sideboard decisions (possibly for a good laugh).</p> <p>Round 1: R/G Zoo 2-0 The tournament unfortunately began with a tough mulligan for my opponent. Ernie’s were abundant and I had the edge in the “Forestwalk mirror” with GG+Berserk. Game two was much closer, but my large fliers were able to make decently quick work of the apes. No sideboard was used.</p> <p>Round 2: WRB Tempo 0-2 My opponent ended up placing first! I would consider myself an Xpt novice, but it’s easy to spot a tough opponent. I lost game 1 to a well timed LOA. I was able to see enough of the deck to already be worried for game two. Serra Angels, Trikes and Derelor(!!) ultimately did me in, despite a couple futile tricks from me. Good games! – this is going to be a chronically tough archetype for my deck. Sideboard: +2 Ashes to Ashes, +1 Elvish Scout, +1 Bog Wraith, -4 Ernham Djinn.</p> <p>Round 3: WRU 2-0 My first blue opponent, and I’m immediately wary of psionic blast plus the other removal suites. I’m in untested waters with Voltron. Despite giving my opponent the additional 2 colors to complete the spectrum, and dancing around Triskeleon, I was able cleanly win these matches with steady pressure, flying, and dodging some removal. Sideboard: +2 Avoid fate, -1 elf, -1 wil-o-the-wisp</p> <p>Round 4: R/G Relic Barrier aggro 2-0 This was definitely the wildest matchup of the day. The details on game one are a bit hazy, but in the GvG matchup, my giant growth and berserks felt strong. Game two came down to a …unique board state. A fast start by my opponent and then Ashes to Ashes from me brought me to a quick 6 life and left us both exhausted. I leaned on maze of ith, and a sylvan library to frantically dig, while my opponent landed a winter orb and built up 3 (!) howling mines. After looking at what felt like nearly half my deck to find a second black source (I never found one btw), I was able to cast a dark ritual into an Angel and luckily land the winning blow as my deck was designed. Sideboard: +2 ashes to ashes, +1 elvish scout, -2 Ernham Djinn</p> <p>Round 5: Disco Troll 2-1 This figured to be a difficult matchup for me, but game 1 I led with an unanswered Scavenger folk, and then some big combat tricks to count to 20. Winning game one here felt critical. Game 2 took about 40 minutes. I started off confident but quickly ran into multiple maze of Iths. Fallen Angel couldn’t quite get there, and a mid-game misplay on my end left me 4 life more vulnerable to a giant fireball. Fireball eventually got me as I hid behind my own mazes. Game 3 started with 2 minutes left and I’m really unsure how it may have ended. Despite a strong start on my end, another Maze from the disco-trolls forced turns, and a subsequent Orb-Flip off! With the very man whom I lost my last “high stakes” Flip-off to (Adam Mumford) as audience, I was able to land 3 successful flips, and my opponent only 2. Great games! Sideboard: +2 Ashes to Ashes, +1 Bog Wraith +1 Elvish Scout, -2 Ernham Djinn, -1 llanowar elf.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ohioheroes/october25xpoint/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="ornithopter">Ornithopter</h2> <p>There was also a sub-game throughout the tournament involving ornithopter. This was a sort of “capture the flag” – if an unblocked ornithopter made it through combat, that player received the “flag” for the turn (like the Monarch mechanic). At the end of the tournament whoever ended games with the most flags won a super-cool Amy Weber painted proof!

Until next time.</p> <h2 id="post-mortem">Post Mortem</h2> <p>Xpt is great and I can certainly see why it’s so popular. Maze x4 with a limit of 1 strip mine is a potential issue IMO. I feel like EC rules with strips at 1pt a pop would be safe.</p> <p>With more experience, I think I may have leaned on my sideboard a bit more. Ashes to Ashes was really the only card I reached for. Hypnotic specter was an unsung hero. My opponents got to discard 0 cards all day, but he took all that removal like a champ.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mike Klements</name></author><category term="Tournaments"/><category term="OldSchool"/><category term="XPoints"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ohio Heroes X-Points Tournament]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">FE40 World Championship II</title><link href="https://clevelandrocs.net/articles/2025/08/23/FEChamps2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="FE40 World Championship II"/><published>2025-08-23T21:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-23T21:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://clevelandrocs.net/articles/2025/08/23/FEChamps2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://clevelandrocs.net/articles/2025/08/23/FEChamps2/"><![CDATA[<figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FEChamps2/tokens-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FEChamps2/tokens-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FEChamps2/tokens-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FEChamps2/tokens.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="the-tournament">The Tournament</h2> <p>On 8/23/25 we hosted the second “Fallen Empires 40 World Championships”! This was again hosted by Mike Klements + Craig Snook (back by popular demand) at Shuffler’s Den in Willoughby Hills, OH! As the initial “World Champs” event was a hit, it felt only appropriate to keep the FE train going and concentrate the fun! After the FE main event, we hosted a full 93/94 EC tournament as well! (yes, that was a lot of Magic!) Attendees came across state lines with great representation from WV + PA and across OH! 21 players in total were in attendance.</p> <p>Prizes and door prizes included many donated prizes, classy Top 8 mugs, THE trophy, and glory. In the spirit of FE, no entry fee was present, and for the champs event donations were happily accepted directly to the <a href="https://www.ostomy.org/5k/">UOAA</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-format">The Format</h2> <p>Fallen Empires 40 is a unique “rubber band” OS-adjacent format that uses Fallen Empires as the core set. “Traditional” FE40 gained some international popularity via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/468172425315016">webcam leagues</a> and has established itself as a beloved niche format in Northeast Ohio and beyond. As of the writing of this report, it has celebrated 36 consecutive online leagues with global winners representing countries as far as Austrailia, Denmark, France, Canada, and many others. Some varying “splash” themes has kept the online league fresh throughout the years.</p> <p>Traditional FE40: 40 card deck minimum with a 5 card sideboard.

Moffett, Science Magazine</p> </blockquote> <p>On March 30, 2024, the first Fallen Empires 40 World Championship tournament was held at The Shuffler’s Den in Willoughby Hills, Ohio. My family and I happened to be approximately 9 hours closer than we would have been, thanks to visiting family for the Easter holidays. I could not pass up the chance to meet many friends I have made since the pandemic playing with old cards over webcam, and a serialized 001/001 foil Ring of Renewal made for some plump prey as well.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/the-ring-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/the-ring-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/the-ring-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/the-ring.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="the-deck">The Deck</h2> <blockquote> <p>“The mega-sized army ant forces are strategically coordinated so that the few Braveheart-caliber killers can sweep in and destroy, but only after expendable workers have rendered the enemy helpless. In a move that’s also known as “the death blow,” a soldier ant – whose huge head is packed with muscles for gut-crushing obliteration – eventually advances from behind the front lines and takes out the termite adversary.”</p> <p>-Katie Drummond, Wired Magazine</p> </blockquote> <p>For three months in 2023, the Fallen Empires 40 league allowed varying amounts of Homelands cards, and the most uncomfortable of these for me to play against was the lowly Carapace. It cost me so many resources to remove an opponent’s creature, such as a Thallid Devourer or Thorn Thallid, and that creature was able to carry the opponent to victory.</p> <p>In the absence of Carapace, and determined to brew something new, I started the deck with 4 Thrull Retainer. The next four creatures were those that could single-handedly do a lot of damage to the opponent, my “queens”: 4 Order of the Ebon Hand would dodge white removal and blockers (which I expected to face much); 4 Thrull Champions would defeat opposing Thrulls. Both of these creatures are also good against Orgg. If these 8 creatures were going to be good, I wanted them to be very good, so I played 10 pieces of protection and ways to make them stronger. As for a plan versus Deep Spawn or Thallids, well, I just hoped to draw and play well. Without further delay, the deck:</p> <h2 id="the-queens-also-known-as-the-death-blow">The Queens (also known as “the death blow”)</h2> <blockquote> <p>Queen ants will do whatever it takes to be the last one standing.</p> <p>-Jeanna Bryner, LiveScience</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>4 Order of the Ebon Hand</li> <li>4 Thrull Champion</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-protection-also-known-as-the-expendable-workers">The Protection (also known as “the expendable workers”)</h2> <blockquote> <p>The tiny “minor” workers move quickly to the front lines—the danger zone where competing ant colonies or prey are first encountered.

I was happy to see Goblin Kites!</p> <p>Unfortunately, her strategy did not match up well against Thrull Champion; her Necrites and Mindstab Thrulls no longer had the requisite toughness of 2 or less, so they could not be flung into the air with goblin weaponry. Additionally, she drew too many lands in both of our games. She did make a go of it, though, in game 2: her Necrite resolved a turn sooner than my lone creature, a Thrull Champion, so I was forced to block the Necrite or have the Champion destroyed. My next turn I had an Armor Thrull and a Soul Exchange to bring the Champion back as a 5/5. While her bad luck in an already tough matchup made for a quick match, I was glad to speak with her about Modern and Legacy. Between her and Klements, I am nearly convinced to try Legacy one day.</p> <p>1-0, 2-0</p> <h2 id="round-2---vs-jason-playing----protect-the-queen">Round 2 - vs. Jason playing . . . Protect the Queen</h2> <p>Well, so much for having brewed up something unique! If I am going to play a deck within about 5 cards of someone else’s, though, at least let that someone else be Jason. He is a tough builder and opponent.</p> <p>Games 1 and 2 my Ebon Strongholds and sideboard Basal Thrulls proved indispensable. I was able to play Thrull Champions before he was, so it was just a matter of using my Orders, Aeolipiles, and Dwarven Catapults to beat his Orders.</p> <p>2-0, 4-0</p> <h2 id="round-3---vs-adam-playing-deep-spawn-reanimator">Round 3 - vs. Adam playing Deep Spawn Reanimator</h2> <p>I was glad once I realized who Adam was; he and I have played at least one other 40-card format, and possibly two. He is not a Fallen Empires 40 regular, and his take on Dwarven Armorer, Deep Spawn, Soul Exchange was fresh and fun. He included Order of the Ebon Hand, which I had not seen in similar decklists before.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/adam-decklist-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/adam-decklist-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/adam-decklist-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/adam-decklist.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Game 1 Adam fails to play Sand Silos or to land a Dwarven Armorer within a reasonable time frame. At one point, I chose to target a summoning sick Dwarven Armorer with Aeolipile instead of one of his 2 Order of the Ebon Hand, and I think it was the correct choice. Next turn he could have upgraded that Armorer into a 6/6 lobstrosity. As it was, my high-toughness Thrulls were able to outclass his Orders of the Ebon Hand and minimal black mana.</p> <p>In game 2 Adam’s Mountains are shy, so he is limited to his small black creatures. My Thrull Champion is able to gain control of his Thrull Wizard (which he promptly targets with his own Aeolipile instead), and my Catapult is able to deal with his Orders. A Thrull army takes him down within two turns.</p> <p>At some point during match 3 I glance over to the neighboring match to see a Farrel’s Zealot, enchanted with Farrel’s Mantle and targeted by Goblin Kites, deal 4 damage to one creature and 3 damage to another. The player then won his coin toss, so the Zealot stayed on the battlefield to do it again. Just disgusting, what a play! I shook my head and struggled to believe none of the FE40 regulars had found this interaction yet. Throughout the day, it was refreshing to see outside perspectives on the format.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-decklist-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-decklist-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-decklist-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-decklist.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="round-4---vs-mitch-playing-mono-red-aggro">Round 4 - vs. Mitch playing Mono Red Aggro</h2> <p>Mitch is an artist local to the Shuffler’s Den area, and he provided basic land artwork to match the aesthetics of Fallen Empires. They are beautiful pieces, which I am sure anyone reading this report already knows. I am not sure whether he intended to play in the tournament, but here we met at the finals. He has borrowed a deck from Mike Klements, and it is another brew that I have not encountered after over two years playing the format.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-basics-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-basics-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-basics-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/mitch-basics.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In most formats, I gravitate toward red. I blame John Ekleberry. A while ago I crunched the numbers to apply Sligh principles from 1995 to 40-card formats. While my result was similar to Mitch’s/Mike’s, there were a few notable changes in the build I was about to face, including enough Goblin Chirurgeons to support a single Goblin Grenade, and Goblin War Drums to make my life very uncomfortable.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/grenades-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/grenades-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/grenades-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FE1Drinkard/grenades.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Game 1 was relatively simple. I played big creatures; I protected them; and my Aeolipiles and Dwarven Catapults cleaned up the board.</p> <p>Game 2 was a nightmare. Dwarven Soldier and Dwarven Lieutenant combined with Goblin War Drums to ensure that I was going to take chip damage. Aeolipiles targeted face. Finally we got to a situation where I could not attack Mitch and still have enough blockers to satisfy the War Drums, and Mitch could not attack me without losing his creatures to my massive Thrull defenses. We played draw-go, but the entire time, he was holding one card in his hand. I hoped it was a Dwarven Catapult made useless by the great amount of toughness on my side; I knew in my heart, though, that it was a Goblin Grenade. Sure enough, after a few turns of staring at one another and playing lands, Mitch plays a Goblin Chirurgeon and immediately follows it up by playing the last card in his hand: Goblin Grenade, killing me.</p> <p>Game 3 started off tense. I kept a creature-light hand. He spent two resources to kill an early Order of the Ebon Hand with Thrull Retainer. I drew many lands, and things looked scary when Mitch attacks me with a Dwarven Soldier and a Brassclaw Orcs. I know I cannot afford many turns like that, but I hoped to bait him into decreasing his clock. Indeed, he plays a second Brassclaw Orcs, and I clear the board with a Dwarven Catapult for x=6. We both limp along, and shortly after, time is called. It is difficult to state how tense things were; he had me in a tricky spot with Goblin War Drums again, and his hand was so full. I feared the worst: a Goblin Grenade here, a Dwarven pump there, and an Aeolipile could easily finish me off if a creature or two got through. On the last turn, my luck truly shined, and I drew my second Dwarven Catapult, earning the extended hand from Mitch. Mitch was a great opponent, though, and I am so thankful for our match and the beautiful contributions he has made to the format with painting!</p> <p>Meanwhile, a couple of yards behind me, the only other undefeated player besides Mitch and myself, John Ekleberry (the champion in all our hearts) lost his match to Jason, my round 2 opponent that was playing a deck very similar to mine. I was relieved; had John and I needed to play, the match could really go either way. His mono white aggro deck can get away from Dwarven Catapult and Order of the Ebon Hand. That being said, instead of pairings being announced for round 5, Mike Klements started his sentence with “After round four, our champion is,” and things got blurry. I was handed some really sweet prizes, and a number of pictures were taken. I think I had something like a runner’s high.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>Rather than hiding behind stones like Ecuadorian ants, people can also choose to develop alliances among societies of their kind, something ants find impossible. It’s in the pursuit of peace that the brainpower of humans shows our species at its most impressive. Moffett, Smithsonian</p> <p>24 hours after the fact, I am proud to have won the event: many players I have respected for years, and some new players that I found out quickly I needed to respect, were there. Thrull Champion and Order of the Ebon Hand did indeed win their games, especially with +2/+2 counters, +1/+2 counters, and Thrull Retainers. Still, though, the stronger feeling I have is gladness to have met these great players in person, and I still can’t shake the enjoyment I had from such a well-run, hype-filled event. Fallen Empires cards were the first Magic cards I ever bought. Seasinger was the first card I ever saw (bounty prizes for anyone who gets her to work!). Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves because this really is a great format. Because of banding, first strike, face up Aeolipiles and Elven Lyres, Dwarven Catapults, Thorn Thallids, Armor Thrulls, and so much more, every land you tap, and every creature you choose to attack with, really matters. The format is missing a lot: removal, higher power level cards, some of the nostalgic pieces of our youth, but for what it lacks, it makes up for in games that require many decisions. Nothing is settled for many turns, and I think some Old School and Premodern formats and players will find that experience rewarding and refreshing.</p> <p>Thank you for indulging me. I wrote this mainly for myself, but I used to enjoy the tournament report section of the forum called themanadrain, during the Type 1 era (as it was known then) in the early 00’s. If anyone misses those, here is my offering to you. I will close with a list of cards I think “broke out” this tournament. As I type that, I realize it is wild to say, since our format has just over 100 cards and is over 2 years old. Still, the people brought the spice, and there were some jaws dropped when various cards and interactions hit the table.</p> <ul> <li>Thrull Retainer</li> <li>Elven Lyre</li> <li>Farrel’s Zealot</li> <li>Farrel’s Mantle</li> <li>Goblin Kites</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The last three were all from the same deck!

The event was planned by the Ebon Hand Old School group out of Cincinnati, and was held in West Lafayette, OH. Like all Old School events, it was a great excuse to get together with old and new friends and cast some spells with some like-minded wizards, and I had a blast!</p> <p>The main event on Saturday was a 3 man, team unified Old School event and began at noon. The night before, there was a St. Patrick’s themed event (more about this below) and a couple other pop up 8 man tournaments. Throughout the weekend, players from different clubs could battle for 5 points a match for their respective club. The winner of an 8 man event would win 60 points, 2nd place would win 30 points for their club, and the main event would award 100 points (300 for the team) for first place, 50 (150 for the team) for second. All events would use EC rules for Old School.</p> <p>I happened to be off on that Friday, but would not be able to participate in the main event on Saturday due to prior obligations, so I decided to head down for the start of open gaming on Friday to make some new friends and maybe get some points for the Cleveland Rocs on the board.</p> <p>When I rolled up, I arrived just a little before 5:00, the official start time. I met the Ebon Hand crew, who were not only wonderful hosts, but incredibly welcoming gentlemen as well. They handed me my SWAG pile and we got right down to gaming.</p> <h2 id="real-nice-swag-piles">Real nice swag piles!</h2> <p>At this point I should mention that I only own one Old School deck and simply did not have time to brew anything else up, so I went in with that being my only cudgel for the weekend. I might have missed the spirit of the event without some janky brews of my own on tap, but hey, I like my aggro decks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/decklist.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/decklist.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>My only Old School deck, based on Charles’ Kird Ape Deck (the top left cards are Grizzly bears or Barbary Apes)</p> <p>I sat down with Brian for the first match of the event and slung some Old School – he was playing a very interesting red/white walls deck that relied on Diamond Valley to gain insane amounts of life off some cheap red walls that would later get animated to thump in once he’d stabilized. Spice level 1000. I ended up 2-1 vs. him in a real squeaker of a match, with game three going very long but no Diamond Valleys in sight to bail him out. First blood was had, the Cleveland Rocs were up 5-0</p> <p>I got to put 5 points on this bad boy and ring the gong. Yes there was a gong. Yes it was legit.</p> <p>Next up, I sat down with Jason from the Ebon Hand to play some Premodern with my Middle School Tax/Rack deck. Jason was on Goblins and I was scared, but I knew if I mulliganed to my pro-red guys I might have a chance. After getting stomped game 1 by the goblins, I vowed to mull to the answers and boy did the deck deliver. I want to be super clear – I got extremely lucky vs. Jason! I drew bolts and swords when I needed them and had pro-red shadow guys each game that I had to mull to find. Jason adeptly played around the land taxes and made me earn the wins, but a few games later, I got to update the scoreboard again 10-0 Rocs.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/mrT.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/mrT.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>An old shot of the deck – it hasn’t changed At this point, the Ebon Hand guys were convinced I was some kind of ringer because I was winning and I knew Rajah. I didn’t mind the reputation, but I also knew there were many games ahead of me and that I would be found out sooner or later.</p> <p>Brian requested the rematch (he switched decks) and I obliged. This time around Brian handily defeated me in 2 games, at one point swinging for 20+ damage with 3 Clockwork Beasts and a Vesuvan Doppelganger… it was brutal! The Ebon Hand had drawn their first blood and was eager for more.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/points.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/points.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>This is one of three pictures I have of the scoreboard</p> <p>It was around this time Ben showed up and we got to eight players. Brian busted out the Mirage Cube and we drafted. I’ve always loved draft, especially weird formats like this so I was excited to check out the cube. As the cards were being passed, I could tell Brian spared no expense on the cube (I picked a Vampiric Tutor at some point!) but it was also well crafted with some clear strategies in the colors. Too bad I didn’t see them until too late- I focused on drafting playable creatures and removal and ended up mono-black aggro. I managed to outlast Brandon round one and Ben round two. For the finals I was playing Brian again for 60 points. I ended up taking it down and earning 60 more for the Rocs. I was feeling good and on a streak!</p> <p>At this point in the evening we added Rajah, our 9th man for the Green themed Tournament. The Ebon Hand dudes cooked up a wild format – for sake of ease, here’s the “emblem” we played with. Think commander rules, but for a leprechaun.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/emblem-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BFO2023/emblem-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BFO2023/emblem-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/emblem.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="play-green">PLAY GREEN!</h2> <p>As I mentioned above, I only had one OS deck, but lucky for me, it was mostly green and I felt like I could work around the negative side. As a side note, I don’t drink these days, so I had to get creative with the “take a drink” handicap, but I feel like most Old School players don’t need to be told to drink…</p> <p>First round I was paired up with Jonathan. He had a real sweet green-artifact deck brewed up and chose to not sleeve his deck, which I really appreciated. The emblem added a very interesting dynamic to the game, where the Leprechaun could be used as a green dark ritual or life gain in a pinch if your opponent was on non-green cards. Jonathan had played just enough artifacts to get me the mana for enough damage through his lifegain to squeak out the win in game three!</p> <p>Second round I played Eric. I absolutely loved Eric’s chaotic energy (the man was eating a cold steak with bacon on it sans utensils and drinking “Viking blood” out of a skull) and he brought that same energy to the match with a mono green deck that was tough to beat. While I don’t remember losing game 1 at all, I managed to get there in game two around his lifegain and beaters. Game three I had the luck of the Irish on my side and was able to get ahead on damage and get in for the Channel-Fireball win. on turn three.</p> <p>Round three I had the pleasure of facing Brian again for the points and prestige. Brian’s deck was well tuned for the format with a plethora of green beats and some Green Wards as backup. I don’t remember the exact details, but I feel like his deck failed him and he sputtered out on mana game three, allowing me to take it down. 60 more points on the board for the Rocs. At this point I’m afraid I’m not making any friends anymore!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/swag.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/swag.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="prizes-and-swag-from-the-weekend">Prizes and SWAG from the weekend</h2> <p>We finished the night off with one final event, the 1996 top 8 World Championship Decks. I proposed we take the same decks as our placement in the St. Patty’s event, because I know how hard the Michael Loconto deck can be to play with (and that it’s not really the best deck in that box set!). Round 1 I played Steve on the Bertrand Lestree deck and somehow pulled together the win. Round 2 I played Rajah on Shawn Hammer Reginer’s deck and won 2-0, and that set me up for Brian yet again, this time on Leon Lindback’s Necropotence deck. Once again, I drew exactly what I needed to take the match and earn 60 more points for the Cleveland Rocs.</p> <p>I had no idea I was going to roll into this thing and rack up the score for the team. I think we all get those weekends or events where we just catch fire and the decks provide and I am certainly lucky to have had that this past Friday! More importantly, I got to meet and play cards with a bunch of great guys from across the state. It was truly a pleasure to sit down with Brian, Jason, Steve, Brandon, Eric, and Jonathan and see the wild decks they all brought. Say what you want about the Ebon Hand, they brew some wild decks and I saw a lot of cool card interactions from those guys.</p> <p>I had to peace out the next morning, so I can’t report on the events that occurred on Saturday, but I will show you this picture of the final scoreboard and my fellow Rocs, Rajah, Kyle, and Steven. So proud of the boys for taking it all down for the land!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BFO2023/finalpoints.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/BFO2023/finalpoints.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="final-scores">Final scores!</h2> <p>Most importantly, I want to say thanks to Brandon, Brian, and anyone else from the Ebon Hand who came up with the idea and made it all possible.
