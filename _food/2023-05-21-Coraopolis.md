After the event we found <a href="https://bigshotbobs.com/#coraopolis">Big Shot Bob's Wings</a> and popped in for a bite. These were some of the best wings I ever had. I remember the gold sauce was especially outstanding. They even have a flavor named Old School!

Thanks to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/261338574383877/">Iron City</a> crew for a great event and an opportunity to smash these wings.
