This is more of a travel report than a tournament report because I’m writing it 3.5 years later, and have forgotten all specifics. What I do remember, though, are great vibes from the Montreal crew. It was a fun tournament run by some of the most gracious and hospitable titans of old school magic on a beautiful Saturday in June in the largest city in the province of Quebec, the second-largest in Canada, and the eighth-largest in North America - Mount Royal, aka Montreal. What a place.

We stayed at Hotel Omni which was across the street from McGill University; a nice urban campus from what I can tell. McGill has many famous alumni, according to the Google search you can do yourself. We were also near the bottom of a very large hill, which turned out to be the namesake of the city. Mount Royal is 4,500 feet tall, which is about 38,000 meters when converted to beaver tails. We climbed to the top and it was really nice up there. Somehow a small lake exists at the top of the mountain and it’s stocked with goldfish. Quirky! You can get snacks up there too, so definitely make the hike.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/topofthemountain-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/topofthemountain-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/topofthemountain-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/topofthemountain.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/poutine-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/poutine-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/poutine-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/poutine.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The Tundra Wolves club at the time had a penchant for sharing the ‘kit’ they were bringing to the tournament, so I shared mine:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/kit-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/kit-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/kit-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/kit.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="trains-and-automobiles-and-buses">TRAINS and AUTOMOBILES and BUSES</h2> <p>My son and I took the double decker bus tour and I couldn’t hear the tour guide so I am making up these facts. But the bus ride was really fun, taking us all around the city up and down busy streets and near old buildings with interesting history and cool stories, and my kid only complained a couple times. We also took a car to the <a href="https://parcolympique.qc.ca/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Montreal Olympic Park</a> and checked out the olympic sized pool. I remember the cabbie giving me his number and driving off. When we were done with our tour, I called his number and he said “yeah that’s a bit far, just take the train” so we figured out the Montreal train system. I hope he’s doing well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Caitlyn Jenner: The Montreal Olympics were in July 1976, the bicentennial, at the height of patriotism.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/olympicpool-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/olympicpool-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/olympicpool-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/TundraWolvesV/olympicpool.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="nature">NATURE</h2> <p>Right (or maybe left) next to the Olympic Park, or maybe part of the park; anyway situated within the same concrete paved area, is the Montreal <a href="https://espacepourlavie.ca/biodome" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Biodome</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bud: I propose that we plant these seeds and I know what your thinkin’ “Illegal!

But, when you do, make sure that there isn’t a prom or homecoming or wedding or bar mitzvah taking up the entire boat. Or if there is, dress accordingly. We wore jeans and hoodies to a black tie event on the water but luckily had the excuse that we were simple American tourists who didn’t understand French Canadian customs. We also walked there from our hotel which took a bit over an hour made our kid a bit cranky, so we tried to just go with the flow and everyone laughed with (at?) us and it was fine. Actually it was quite nice and we even got to join a class action lawsuit against the boat company for improper credit card charging or something to that effect.
