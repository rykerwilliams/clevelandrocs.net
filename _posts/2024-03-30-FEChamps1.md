## The Tournament
On what might have been the dreariest NEOH day of the year (3/24/24) we celebrated the 30th anniversary of our beloved Fallen Empires expansion with the first ever “Fallen Empires 40 World Championship” hosted by Mike Klements + Craig Snook at Shuffler’s Den in Willoughby Hills, OH!

This tournament served as both a competitive event, and giant birthday party for FE (cupcakes included)! For those unfamiliar, Fallen Empires 40 gained some international popularity via webcam leagues (https://www.facebook.com/groups/468172425315016) and has established itself as a beloved “rubber band” and webcam format in Northeast Ohio and beyond.

## The Format

Traditional FE 40: 40 card deck minimum with a 5 card sideboard. Modern rules + Mana burn
Restrictions: Hymn to Tourach is banned, Hand of Justice, Dwarven Catapult + Icatian Javelineers are restricted to 2.  
20 players faced off in the main Swiss event from as far as NC, MI, and PA to battle for the title of the King of Sarpadia! Prizes and door prizes included many donated prizes, unique FE swag, a “1 of 1” Ring,  and the loser getting to hit the catered buffet first! 

## Swag
Swag Bag tokens:

## Finals
After Swiss rounds, our finals boiled down to local FE land artist Mitty Harmon (on mono red) and online league juggernaut Troy Drinkard (on “protect the queen”). Troy emerged victorious 2-1 in close matches as our first live event FE40 champion! 

He wrote a glorious tournament report that can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JhSvmEoZAl61pSGAMu3TEFhc37NkSpd6MF4fg-hMvA/edit">here</a>

## Side Events
Side events included 3 casual 93/94 rounds and a “Sarpadia Remastered” cube draft! (Won by Garrett Demko 3-0 on a disgusting W/G pile over Taylor Kane.) https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/SarpadiaRemastered
The “Sarpadia Remastered” cube is a casual product of many months of FE40 online league results, and an unhealthy dive into the deep lore of the plane. 

## Action
As with all OS events, we were heavy on fun and light on cameras and cost – thanks Kyle Wells for providing most of our photo proof of the FE40 Champs!
